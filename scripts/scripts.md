Note: Please to use as much as possible, Variables, Arrays, Functions and Classes for developing your scripts in any language possible, unless specified differently.

* Create a bello script: hello world script written in bash, that says hello to logged in user. The script should NOT say hello to Root and should dismiss him with notification that is not allowed to run script with Root user. In case of passing an argument to a script, for example different user-name, the script should say hello to other user-name.

* Automate LAMP installation: Linux, Apache, Mysql and Php/Python/Pel/Ruby. This script should be modular as possible and should provide an versatile option to install, configure and deploy needed application from version control server.

* Automate static network configuration with nmcli: create a script that will work in several modes:
  * GUI/TUI modes - graphical/terminal automation menu that will guide a user to configure static ip, hostname, bridging.
  * Parameter passing - passing argument with specific requests of ip/hostname/brdging configuration.

* Automate log-rotation of application output file: You are new Sysadmin at a small startup company, where one of the first task given to you, is to manage company's application logs.
